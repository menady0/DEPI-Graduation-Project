              A hidden gem in the heart of Zamalek! From the moment I stepped
              into Coffee Fly, I felt like I was in another world. The vibe is
              incredibly relaxing, and the staff is so friendly and attentive. I
              tried their Cairo Macchiato, and it was hands down one of the best
              coffee drinks I've ever had. The flavor profile was rich,
              balanced, and perfectly spiced. I also couldn't resist the Kunafa
              Croissant—it was divine! I’ll definitely be back for more.

              Coffee Fly has quickly become my go-to spot for coffee in Cairo!
              The quality of their coffee is unmatched, and their attention to
              detail really sets them apart. I love how they offer both
              international brews and local Egyptian-inspired drinks. Their
              Karkadeh Cold Brew is so refreshing, and the Basbousa Cheesecake
              is the perfect treat to pair with it. The atmosphere is cozy yet
              stylish, and the team always greets you with a smile. Highly
              recommend!

              I’m a coffee enthusiast, and I've visited coffee shops all around
              the world, but Coffee Fly has truly captured my heart. The team’s
              expertise is evident in every cup they serve. The Sahlab Latte was
              a new experience for me, and I absolutely loved it. The flavors
              were comforting and uniquely Egyptian. The staff is knowledgeable
              and passionate, which really makes a difference in the overall
              experience.
